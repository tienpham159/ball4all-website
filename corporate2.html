</ul>

<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Copywriting</h5>
<p>The tone of voice we used across Ball4All’s platforms is youthful, confident and assertive since our target audience is male football players aged 18-23. We want to create relatability and a close connection with our customers to gain trust and credibility. Additionally, since our target audience are primarily young people, we also implement modern slangs and football-related trends to reach the desired audience. Since our brand revolves around football, an energetic presence is significant for the branding consistency. As such, we use proactive call-for-action phrases to increase customers’s engagement with our services.</p>

<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Visual Identity</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Brand values/personality/audience</h6>
<ul>
  <li>
    Based on our values and target audience, our brand design aims to express youthfulness, masculinity, a sense of belonging and passion. Therefore, we decide to use clean shapes and sharp graphic elements, as well as highly-saturated colors.
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Brand logo</h6>
<ul>
  <li>The logo is designed based on our unique brand feature - the digital baller passport. As such, we incorporated the image of a stamp and football into the logo design. Because our brand targets male football players, we utilize clean shapes and sharp lines to evoke a sense of masculinity and efficiency. Our logo is designed with the primary colors (dark green, green, and orange) in our color palette to convey our values as best as possible. Since our brand provide football-related service, the image of a football is crucial to our brand image. Additionally, the tailed lines next to the football also expresses speed and energy. Combined with our stylized brand name, we want to showcase proactiveness and passion through the logo.</li>

<p>
  To make it easier for style applications on social media platforms/website/mobile app, we designed two versions of the logo: the original consisted of the primary brand colors, and the monogram (single-color) logo. The monogram logo is used on busy backgrounds/solid-colored backgrounds so that it can stand out from other elements.
</p>
<p>The stamp-like logo is also utilized in players’ digital passport as a passport stamp that marks their football journey.</p>

    <strong>UI Patterns</strong>
      <p><strong>Navigation Tab:</strong> Navigation tabs provide a clear visual indication of what content can be found on a website and place the current location in context by highlighting it.</p>
	  <p><strong>Testimonial: </strong> Normally companies use testimonials for social proof. This is where a user leaves a review so that the public can see what they had to say about the services etc. This keeps it realistic..</p>
	  <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> This is where users can leave a message that goes directly to the company about how they can improve on their services/websit, etc.</p>
	  <p><strong>Footer: </strong>This is a section of content at the very bottom of the page where it has a sitemap, logo, contact information, social media, etc. Instead of a person scrolling all the way to the top to either go to the homepage or a different page or even the social media pages of the company, they can do it from the footer.</p>
	  <p><strong>Search tab:</strong> A search tab will give them the option to find particular topics or pages fast.If they can’t find what they want to do or the place they want to go on the website they can use the search tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The structure of the navigation and content:</strong>
	<p><strong>The home page:</strong> The home page layout adheres to principles of visual hierarchy, featuring key sections such as our services, about us, and testimonials. We prioritized our services section because our brand focuses on addressing the primary issues of our future clients: scheduling and communication problems. In the "About Us" section, we present our brand vision and values, capturing the essence of Ball4All. The testimonials section showcases reviews from our customers, highlighting how our platform has benefited them, in hopes of resonating with potential future customers who might face similar challenges. The design elements of our home page, including the color palette, imagery, and typography, are thoughtfully chosen to embody our brand's values and personality. The green and orange hues evoke vibrancy and enthusiasm, while the approachable typography and inviting imagery create a welcoming user experience. Through persuasive messaging and captivating visuals, it showcases the advantages of our platform and services, motivating users to delve deeper.</p>
	<p><strong>The Baller Passport page:</strong> Our Baller Passport allows our customers to express themselves off the pitch as well. It showcases a player's professionalism by displaying how often they honored their agreements and showed up for matches, addressing the issue of availability. Creating an account is straightforward; customers simply need to provide their name, phone number, age, position, and location.</p>
	<p><strong>The Pitch booking page:</strong> Our Pitch Booking feature allows our customers to effortlessly book football fields available during their selected time period, ensuring their preferred position is open and the location is convenient. This feature embodies our commitment to flexibility, enabling customers to seamlessly integrate football into their busy schedules. With just a few clicks or taps, users can find and reserve the perfect pitch, providing a stress-free and enjoyable booking experience.</p>
	<p><strong>The Match-making page:</strong> Our Match-making feature supports our customers by displaying available footballers for the specified position. This helps address last-minute pullouts by offering alternative options. When a customer selects a desired teammate, they are automatically redirected to the player's Baller Passport.</p>

<h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
<li>
    <strong>Testing overview</strong>
	<p><strong>Testing Goals:</strong> The objective of these tests is to evaluate the efficiency, usability, brand recognition and the overall format of our website which aims to provide an efficient, community-oriented and diverse platform for amateur football players to set up schedules, book pitches and connect with other players on and off the pitch. The primary goal is clear recognition of our brand’s purpose and a guarantee that the services we provide meet the needs of our target customers. We want to find rooms for improvement in terms of UI/UX, meaning what has worked well for our website and which feature/service needs enhancement.</p>
	<p><strong>Testing Participants:</strong> For our testings, we have chosen three male participants between the age of 20-23 who are amateur football players. These participants are selected based on our target audience for the brand.</p>
	<p><strong>Testing Setting:</strong> The testing of our brand was done both on laptop and mobile, with one test done on mobile format and two tests done on laptop format. The testings were all done on campus to optimize the internet connection. All participants were invited to do the tests separately with two of our interviewers to minimize external influences on the test results.</p>
	<p><strong>Testing Protocol:</strong> Before filming/recording, each participant will be informed of an overview of our brand, the purpose of the testing and necessary instructions. For the next step, participants will be asked to test each features, at the same time giving their opinions and questions. Meanwhile, interviewers will record participants' interactions, acknowledging any difficulties, confusion, or positive experiences. The testing process consisted of the following steps: Setting up a digital Baller Passport, Booking a Pitch, Match with other players, Clicking on different navigation features.</p>
	<p><strong>Testing Results:</strong> Participants identified both disadvantages and advantages of different website features/services.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <strong>Positive Aspects of UI/UX:</strong>
	<p><strong>Easy Navigation:</strong> Users found the layout and navigation of the website to be clear and easy, which was great for finding relevant information, especially for a website that offers services.</p>
	<p><strong>Community-oriented design:</strong> Users greatly engaged with the services provided by the website, especially the matchmaking feature. Users stated that the feature was really interesting and helpful for socializing.</p>
	<p><strong>Overall Branding and Design:</strong> Users acknowledge the cohesive branding throughout the website. The website shows a cohesive football/sports theme which quickly engages the users in a visually appealing and welcoming environment.</p>
	<p><strong>Social Media and Contact Accessibility:</strong> Users appreciated the website footer that included social media links and contact information, making it quick and easy to access.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <strong>Negative Aspects of UI/UX:</strong>
	<p><strong>Confusing Wording:</strong> Several participants encountered issues when filling in the "Location" section.</p>
	<p><strong>Error with Phone Number Entry:</strong> One participant experienced a significant issue when entering his phone number. The error message that appeared was misleading, suggesting that the participant needed to type in his email address instead.</p>
	<p><strong>Ambiguous Page Functionality:</strong> Some participants had difficulties understanding the purpose and functionality of the matchmaking page. The page lacked clear instructions and context, leaving users unsure of how to use the feature or what benefits it offered. This ambiguity led to underutilization of the feature and a potential loss of engagement from users who could not see its value.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <strong>Improvements to be Implemented on the Final Website:</strong>
	<p><strong>Clarifying Wording:</strong> To eliminate confusion, we will replace the term "Location" with "Place of Residence." This more specific wording will help users understand exactly what information is required, whether it be their city, state, or full address. By providing clearer instructions, we aim to enhance the user experience and reduce errors during form completion.</p>
	<p><strong>Consistent Navigation Throughout the Website:</strong> While most participants were able to navigate the website efficiently, we will implement a more cohesive navigation structure to ensure all pages are clearly linked. This will help users understand the purpose of each page. Additionally, we will add detailed instructions and a call to action on the matchmaking tab to guide users on how to use the feature effectively. This will improve clarity and engagement, making the feature more accessible and valuable to users.</p>
	<p><strong>Fixing Non-Functional Features:</strong> As our app gains more customers, we will enhance the matchmaking feature by linking it to the selected player's baller passport. For instance, when users click on Kenneth Tran, they will be able to view his baller passport, which includes comprehensive details about his skills, experience, and stats. Furthermore, we will integrate a chat function, allowing users to communicate directly with players or support staff. These enhancements will not only improve functionality but also foster a more interactive and engaging user experience, encouraging users to make the most of the app's features.</p>

         <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-3 mb-3">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
<h6>Our Brand</h6>
<p>At Ball4all, we are on a mission to help users create an easily accessible community amongst amateur football players. In doing research, we discovered that football is an extremely common and popular team sport in The Netherlands, therefore we decided to focus on football to obtain maximum engagement and strengthen a community that is already visible in The Netherlands. In a world where people often have incredibly busy schedules, we aim to provide an accommodating and flexible platform that allows users to still participate in their passion. Our campaign is not only about promoting a product, it is about allowing people to celebrate the joy of football.</p>
<h6>What is the Campaign About?</h6>
<p>The Ball4All campaign revolves around distributing content that builds excitement while introducing our brand features. Through our posts we aim to build a community in the football world, demonstrating how we plan to make their life easier while gaining their trust by incorporating real people’s opinions through street interviews. Through our campaign we aim to spark meaningful conversations and represent the individuals who make up the community of The Netherlands football scene.</p>
<h6>The Message</h6>
<p>The tagline for our campaign is “FWB. Football with Benefits. All the Benefits without Commitment”. Through the tagline our brand aims to demonstrate a company that provides features to help make a footballer's experience and life easier, allowing them to access benefits of the sport without having to commit to a club. Our message is consistently represented throughout our content and social media platforms, including the tagline in videos and our bio, as well as having posts that further explain how we plan to execute our vision.</p>
<p>
  <h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Promotional Activities Executed</h6>
  <em>To bring our message to life and connect with our audience, we've executed a variety of promotional activities:</em>
  <ul>
    <li>Instagram and TikTok Content: We've launched engaging campaigns on Instagram and TikTok to showcase our brand and its features. Through street interviews, brand feature descriptions, brand collaborations and company introduction posts, we have worked towards inviting our viewers to become part of the growing community.</li>
    <li>Brand Collaborations: We have reached out to other brands to collaborate and share each other's content. Through this process we attempted to gain brand connections while continuously promoting and growing our brand.</li>
    <li>Interactive Components and Trends: We've launched interactive components on our stories in an attempt to once again make viewers feel they are connected with the brand and have a voice. In addition, we have posted videos following trends such as street interviews as well as using trending audios in our video to gain traction.</li>
    <li>Hashtags: In each of our posts we ensured to include at least 3-4 hashtags in the caption. These often consisted of tags that correlated with our post, as well as tags that are popular in the football community.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">The Objective - SMART</h6>
<p>(Specific) We want to grow brand awareness by creating different types of content on both Instagram and TikTok. Our content will feature street interviews where we go around the hotspots of Breda, interacting directly with our target audience. Moreover, in these interviews, we ask questions about their difficulties as an amateur football player, whilst also asking about the usability of our features. Therefore, by posting these kinds of videos, we predict that most of our target audience have faced the same problems, creating a sense of belonging. In addressing the difficulties of amateur football players and seeking feedback on our brand features, it will allow our team to create a relatable brand, while genuinely addressing our target audience's needs. Creating a foundation of trust when building a long-lasting community.</p>
<p>(Measurable) Our goal would be to reach 3000 impressions on both platforms. Population of Breda (since we’re going to interact with it the most) 180.000. 6% of the Netherlands’ population play football, extrapolating and applying it to the population of Breda, we have 10.800. 50% are males and given the fact our target audience is based on male amateur football players between the ages of 18-24, 3000 impressions is predicted to be an achievable goal.</p>
<p>(Achievable) By reaching our goal, we will attract more customers towards the website/app, building a long-lasting community in time.</p>
<p>(Timely) We’d like to achieve this goal within a month.</p>

<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">The Selected Channels/Platforms</h6>
<p>We chose Instagram and TikTok as our channels due to the fact that they are the most relevant social media platforms for our target audience, male amateur football players aged 18-23. We got to this conclusion based on interviews with our target audience, all of them mentioning both. However, most of them use TikTok for entertainment and Instagram for both news and entertainment. Therefore, we chose to use Instagram for more “serious” posts such as our feature showcase, and TikTok for more funny, light-hearted content such as “types of footballers”.</p>
<p>In addition, Instagram and TikTok are both known for their engaging formats, providing an ideal platform for sharing content and gaining viewers. The platforms are powerful tools in building brand visibility and reaching a large audience, providing our brand the opportunity to introduce our company to a variety of potential customers. Through the various features that platforms provide, such as stories, reels, reposts and short TikTok our team is provided flexibility to share our content in various forms. Including call-to-action in our posts and utilizing engagement features on our stories, it encourages a relationship with our audience. The platforms allow our team to experiment and discover which format captures our audience's attention most.</p>
<p>Therefore, we utilized the platform's key benefits by incorporating trending audios, hashtags and many additional engagement tactics, in an attempt to reach our goal of 3000 impressions. The platforms provide a sense of community as it often caters to viewers interests, allowing football players in the Netherlands to discover our curated content for the sport.</p>

<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 mb-3">Learning Points</h4>
<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Week One</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram got deleted: </h7>
<ul>
  <li>The Instagram got deleted as it was believed to be a robot account. Therefore, Instagram removed the ball4all account stating that it violates community guidelines. This severely limited our initial outreach as the content was no longer being distributed for viewers to watch.</li>
  <li>Future goal: Our team aimed to create more content and try to reach more viewers so that when our platform was rebooted we had posts to distribute, therefore showing Instagram that we are real people and not a bot.</li>
</ul>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram and TikTok</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Limited reach on TikTok and Instagram:</h7>
<ul>
  <li>Our team was still in the process of developing the foundation of our brand such as the values, mission, and vision. Therefore, we did not want to create concrete content that represented our brand until we finalized the idea. We decided to create a reel that aimed to build anticipation for viewers, showing that our football brand "ball4all" is coming soon, utilizing stock footage and our company logo.</li>

  <h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">WEEK FOUR UPDATE - Instagram:</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>However, once we developed our account further in the following weeks, the first video now has 1042 views, 29 likes, and 1 comment. The view count is broken down into two categories; initial plays being 794 and replays being 248. Unfortunately, the team is not able to access further insights as we did not change our account into a business account until week two.</li>

  </div>
  <h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Week Two</h5>
  <h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
  <h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram got reactivated:</h7>
  <ul>
    <li>Our team was able to get the Instagram account reactivated by filing a report with Instagram. To ensure that this would not happen again, we focused on building the platform to represent to Instagram that this is a real company. This included connecting an email with the Ball4All name in the email, instead of using one of our personal emails. In addition, we posted our first reel and updated the Instagram bio. This allowed us to create a solid foundation for the account.</li>
  </ul>
  <h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Initial Instagram Engagement:</h7>
  <ul>
    <li>After posting the first Instagram Reel, the Ball4All page gained 38 followers. In reflecting, we concluded that this outreach was because of each member of the team sharing the account with family and friends. In posting the reel on our personal accounts stories, our friends began to follow the account and engage with the post.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="col-lg-4">

  </div>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>In addition, our team incorporated hashtags that reflected the post in an attempt to gain further outreach. These hashtags included: #football #onthepitch #footballtime #footballplayer #website #gameon #gearupforglory #footballrevolution #gamechanger #newintown #ultimatefootball. In comparison to our first post, we believe that the hashtags helped our engagement rates, however, we were not able to compare the benefits until trying new hashtags in our next post.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Brand Introduction: </h7>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>In week two, our team also uploaded a static post to our Instagram. The purpose of our post was to introduce our brand to viewers, highlighting our company's purpose and goals. The elements of the post included:</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A summarization of our company goals:</li>
  <ul>	
    <li>A website for amateur football players.</li>
    <li>The company's scheduling and pitch finder features.</li>
    <li>Introducing the Ball4All digital stamp element.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The ball4all company tagline</li>
  <ul> 
    <li>All the benefits without commitment</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The logo</li> 
  <li>The ball4all colour palette:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Green and orange.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The purpose of the introduction post was to represent the highlights of our company while building anticipation and excitement.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Our company aimed to build anticipation by introducing the features and benefits of the app without representing it in too much detail, as we planned to create future posts introducing each feature with detailed descriptions and images. Therefore, we provided viewers with a taste of what's to come.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In addition, we introduced our brand while utilizing a language and dialogue that was targeted for our audience, amateur footballer males 18-25. Our team strayed away from using formal language and a more professional route. Instead, we described our brand using slang, informal language, and lingo that is often used amongst our demographic. This included phrases such as: “kick-it”, “link up”, “no sweat”, “no drama”, and many more.</li>
  <li>The introduction post also demonstrated a rebrand for the ball4all company. In our first post, our team initially wanted to have a more professional looking brand, with cinematic videos and polished language. Therefore, we incorporated a slow-motion video and a darker colour palette. However, in doing research and customer interviews, our team decided that a serious and cinematic marketing plan did not reflect our target audience. Allowing us to transform the page to include more bright colours, slang, abstract shapes, and more.</li>

    <li>The reel was inspired from a popular trend on Instagram and TikTok, by utilizing this trend our team hoped to gain viewers through reliability and humour. </li>
    <li>In addition, we utilized hashtags once more ( #football, #soccer, #ball4all, #netherlands). This allowed the reel to obtain 518 plays, 21 likes and three comments.

</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Posted 3rd TikTok using a new trend. This gained only 250 views on the first day since we decided to post at a different time (went from posting at 2pm to 6 pm). We decided to use a new hashtag such as #netherlands and also added a location to the video and we this gave us a huge boost gaining over 1800 views, 40 likes, and also two comments. We decided to continue adding the #netherlands since it reaches more people.</li>

<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Week Four</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Posting Content: </h7>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>In week four, we focused on releasing plenty of content and posts. Over the weeks we worked on strengthening our brand and vision, therefore by week four we had a solid foundation of our ideas and brand features.</li>
    <li>Through the content we had created and compiled we planned to post a static post and reel each day. We began by posting a “coming soon” post in an attempt to build anticipation and excitement for what our brand was soon going to release. In this post we introduced new hashtags; #unleashthegame, #comingsoon, #football, #soccer, #netherlands, #goal, #gamechanger, as well as posting the content on our story once more. In utilizing these methods, our team was able to reach 13 likes, 4 comments and reach 33 accounts.</li>

<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">New Additions: </h7>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>In week four, our team incorporated new elements in an attempt to increase engagement. We utilized the features Instagram provides for static posts such as adding the location (The Netherlands), a trending song (Carnival - Kanye West, Ty Dollan $ign and Rich The Kid), and tagging accounts (other accounts that specialize in football content).</li>
    <li>These are features we have continuously used throughout the week four and five static posts. We believe it allows viewers to find our content easier by using popular features. In addition, it also made the content more enjoyable to watch and was on theme with our audience as we used songs popular in the football community.</li>
  </ul>

</div>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>We also began sharing content to fellow football Instagram pages and classmate accounts, by reaching out and asking if they would like to promote each other.</li>
    <li>Through this method we were able to get three accounts to share our content on their story, telling their audience to look at our page if they are interested in football. This provided a minimal boost in our content, with the content they promoted getting an additional 40 views and 3-6 more accounts reached.</li>

<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Lack of Engagement: </h7>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>In week five, we continued incorporating Instagram features throughout our static posts, such as audios, locations, and hashtags. However, we noticed a decline in outreach, as we were consistently getting engagement from our followers, with an average of 12 likes per post, however, our outreach to new users was limited.</li>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Therefore, we implemented additional tactics in an attempt to gain more engagement. This involved creating story posts in which followers can share their opinions on football and our brand. However, we discovered that this tactic did not have the best results. Posting “yes or no” questions led us to gaining more responses, however questions in which users needed to answer through text received very limited responses. This taught us that in future we can focus on engagement tactics that involve simple and easy-to-complete tasks on the users' end.</li>

<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 mb-3">Future Planning</h4>
<p>In reflecting on our marketing journey, it is evident that our campaign has undergone significant growth as over time we began to utilize more features on the platform to promote our content. However, it is evident that we did not reach our goal of 3000 impressions. If the project were to continue, we would be able to use the experience we have gained in the month of content creation to implement a strategy aimed at further enhancing engagement and solidifying our brand identity. The following recommendation represents a detailed outline of how we would strive for future success.</p>
<p>1. Transition to a Business Account: The first recommendation and change our team would implement is making our social media accounts a business profile from the beginning. Transforming our platforms into business accounts would allow us to have access to in-depth analytics, representing the growth our company has shown over time and from the beginning. Having this tool would enable us to review engagement insights and reflect on what we can do for each post to improve, such as posting at a different time/day, using different hashtags, and discovering the type of content that our audience enjoys most.</p>
<p>2. Strategic Hashtags: In using hashtags, we believe it has helped our brand to get engagement; therefore, in the future of our campaign, we would continue to utilize relevant and trending hashtags across both social media platforms. However, a change we would implement is doing further research on what hashtags are trending and incorporating a lot more hashtags than 4-5, in order to enhance the chance of viewers discovering our company.</p>
<p>3. Establishing a Consistent Tone of Voice: In reflecting, we discovered that it is crucial to establish a consistent tone of voice that resonates with our target audience from the beginning. Initially, our team wanted to represent a more serious and cinematic approach to our content. However, after doing research, we quickly realized the type of content our target audience typically views, which is more laid back. In addition, we realized the importance of our tone, which was incorporating slang versus professional text, which resonates more with our audience. Therefore, in creating a distinct brand voice, it allows us to connect more with our audience and establish a stronger brand identity.</p>
<p>4. Posting More: In reflecting on the journey of our campaign, it is evident that we should have begun posting content sooner and more frequently. On platforms such as TikTok, posting every day allows a greater chance to reach viewers and appear on users' pages. In addition, posting more frequently allows viewers to engage with content and develop a stronger understanding and relationship with the brand.</p>
<p>Overall, we believe in future planning, by following these future recommendations, discovered through research and content analytics, we believe we can redirect our campaign to increase visibility and growth.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Customer segments
        <ul>
            <li>Getting “team sports players” as our assigned audience group, we decided to narrow down the customer segment to male amateur football players age 18-30 living in the Netherlands, as we assumed having a unique target audience would benefit our brand in looking for specific problems as well as developing features that centralize the target segment. Due to its widespread popularity in the Netherlands and community values, we decided to include football into our audience’s characteristics, and our brand targeted male amateur players since football is primarily male-dominated, and it’s been shown that the professional segment of football is already prioritized, which drove us to put emphasis on the amateur segments for unique problems and solutions.</li>
            <li>Problems: From the customer segment, we determined three main problems that customers may face while playing amateur football, which were schedule flexibility, pitch booking, and finding teammates. Based on which, our initial solution was to develop a platform for male amateur football players that provide the services according to our assumed problems.</li>
            <li>Channels: Our main channels would be our website and social media platforms including Tiktok and Instagram, since the chosen customer segment is primarily Gen Zs and Millennials whose screen time is spent mostly on Instagram and Tiktok. The social media platforms would be utilized for our marketing campaign, supporting the website that provides the services.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<img src="images/lean-canvas2.jpeg" width="600" alt=""/>
<p class="fw-bold mt-3">Justification</p>
<ul>
    <li>To clearly identify the customers’ problems, our interview questions focus on both the social and psychological benefits that football brings to them, as well as personal life aspects that are football-related for hidden problems.</li>
    <li>The majority of our interviewees expressed these primary traits and concerns:</li>
    <li>Football was introduced to them from a very early age, mostly by male family members/friends or their favorite teams. Some stated that they were influenced by acquaintances who played professional football.</li>
    <li>They use social media platforms to stay updated about football news and events. They follow fan/official accounts of renowned football clubs on Instagram, and also use this platform to connect with other players and organize matches in local areas. WhatsApp is also utilized to contact teammates and regulate matches.</li>
    <li>Football provides them with a sense of community and accomplishment. The sport also aids them in socializing and stress relieving.</li>
    <li>Their frustrations include lack of equipment/fields, communication issues (hard to contact people/finding teammates through social media platforms, schedule flexibility, and lack of motivation due to the above difficulties.</li>
</ul>
          <p class="fw-bold mt-3">Lean canvas modifications</p>
<ul>
    <li>Customer segments- We realized that there’s a significant difference in lifestyles between age 18-25 and 25-30. The academic, professional, and social commitments will differentiate age 18-25 from 25-30 regarding football playing habits, spending habits, and availability. As a result, we modify our customer segment to age group 18-23 for a more focused brand identity and services.</li>
    <li>Problems- Based on the problem interviews, we were able to identify two main problems: Communication: The lack of a convenient and cohesive communicating platform prevents the players from finding available teammates, regulating matches, and looking for good facilities. Miscommunication causes a lot of disruptions in playing time which is already limited due to work and personal life. Schedule flexibility: The misalignment in availability makes it difficult for players to meet up and organize matches together.</li>
    <li>Solutions: We came up with three brand features that potentially solve the identified problems: Availability input: The players are able to set up their schedules on the website to see which fields/players are available at a chosen time frame. Pitch booking: The feature introduces a list of available pitches for players to choose at a specific time frame. Digital baller passport: A digital passport for players to display their information and collect digital stamps given to them after each match. Match-making: The feature matches players with other players who are at a specific skill level and available at a chosen time frame. We expected these features to solve disruptions caused by the communication and flexibility issues as well as motivate players to play football.</li>
    <li>Unfair advantage: During our problem interviews, we noticed that the majority of our interviewees expressed great satisfaction towards the sense of accomplishment that scoring goals provides them. As such, we came up with the idea of having a digital baller passport as one of the main brand features. The 2-page passport will show players’ information and availability and a blank space for dated digital stamps (our brand logo) acquired after finishing a match. The passport also allows other players to have basic knowledge of their teammates, making socializing and teaming up easier.</li>
    <li>Cost structure- After our problem interviews, we realized that an app would be more practical for our target audience, so we pivoted towards it. However, we decided to keep the website as a corporate page, given the fact that it is easily accessible. The maintenance cost of an app usually varies based on how complex the app is. Given the fact that our app is straightforward and easy to use, a rough estimate would be around 230 euros per month. Moreover, our website is used mainly to showcase our features, serving as a portal towards the app mostly. Therefore, an estimated maintenance cost for the website would be 370 euros per year. For our marketing campaign, we will collaborate with university students that have (or study towards) a Marketing specialization, for instance BUas Creative Business students during their production house days. We have decided to implement this strategy in order to cut down on costs, given the fact that our app is free and we run solely on external sources of revenue.</li>
    <li>Revenue Streams- Based on our assumptions, our revenue streams should come from both partnerships with football pitches and football equipment ads. The partnerships would be commission based either from a percentage from the bookings made through our app, or a flat fee for each referral. Based on our problem interviews where our target audience was struggling with finding the right equipment, we would also run ads displaying football equipment from different manufacturers. These ads can be targeted based on user preferences, location, and other relevant data to maximize engagement and conversion rates. An exact percentage would be difficult to provide, since data could not be found of similar business models. For the sake of this project, we would take 10% of booking as an example. Given the fact that in our problem interviews, our target audience mentioned the fact that they would like to play football once a week, and a month is comprised of roughly four weeks, we anticipate 4 matches per month. Moreover, the average rate for booking a football pitch in the Netherlands is 55 euros.</li>

    <li>Step 1: Put in your availability</li>
    <li>Step 2: Book the pitch that’s available at the chosen time frame</li>
    <li>Step 3: Look through the compatible player profiles to set up a team </li>
</ul>

<p class="fw-bold mt-3">Summary of solution interviews</p>
<ul>
    <li>Our solution interviews focused on confirming the problems and collecting reviews on our product prototype to see if we should pivot or persevere with the current direction.</li>
    <li>Highlights of the interviews:</li>
    <li>One interviewee expressed great frustration (laughing, talking with sarcasm) towards the inconvenience of having to contact people and synchronize schedules through Whatsapp.</li>
    <li>Most interviewees said they would benefit from a feature that helps them connect with compatible players. Some interviewees didn’t have the need for such feature, unless they wanted to meet new people. The feature will be helpful in small areas where you need to select players to make a team.</li>
    <li>The interviewees expressed enthusiasm about a platform where availability options are provided, because it helps them gather a team and organize matches more quickly and easily.</li>
    <li>The interviewees find it unnecessary for a skill level input feature, because to them “winning is important but fun is the top priority”. It depends on each player’ purpose of playing football.</li>
    <li>The interviewees looked forward to the feature where they can see the availability of the pitches which allows them to book in advance, because they’d prefer to have a familiar field to play regularly to having to switch fields every week.</li>
    <li>One interviewee stated that it would be helpful to add players’ (preferred) positions to their profile.</li>
    <li>One interviewee said that they really enjoyed the fact that you can see who you are playing with beforehand and not find out on the spot.</li>
    <li>One interviewee said that we should include a second feature in which they can also invite friends to join their team. </li>
</ul>
        <p class="fw-bold mt-3">Conclusion</p>
<ul>
    <li>The customers recognized the problems and found most product features helpful. We removed the skill level feature and decided to persevere with the rest.</li>
