          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-3 mb-3">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		  <h6> Our Brand </h6>
          <p>At Ball4all, we are on a mission to help users create an easily accessible community amongst amateur football players. In doing research, we discovered that football is an extremely common and popular team sport in The Netherlands, therefore we decided to focus on football to obtain maximum engagement and strengthen a community that is already visible in The Netherlands. In a world where people often have incredibly busy schedules, we aim to provide an accommodating and flexible platform that allows users to still participate in their passion. Our campaign is not only about promoting a product, it is about allowing people to celebrate the joy of football. </p>
          <h6> What is the Campaign About? </h6>
          <p>The Ball4All campaign revolves around distributing content that builds excitement while introducing our brand features. Through our posts we aim to build a community in the football world, demonstrating how we plan to make their life easier while gaining their trust by incorporating real people’ opinions through street interviews. Through our campaign we aim to spark meaningful conversations and represent the individuals who make up the community of The Netherlands football scene. </p>
		  <h6>The Message</h6>
          <p>The tagline for our campaign is “FWB. Football with Benefits. All the Benefits without Commitment”. Through the tagline our brand aims to demonstrate a company that provides features to help make a footballers experience and life easier, allowing them to access benefits of the sport without having to commit to a club. Our message is consistently represented throughout our content and social media platforms, including the tagline in videos and our bio, as well as having posts that further explain how we plan to execute our vision.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 mb-3">Learning Points</h4>
		<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Week One</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram got deleted: </h7>
          <p>
          <li>The Instagram got deleted as it was believed to be a robot account. Therefore, Instagram removed the ball4all account stating that it violates community guidelines. This severely limited our initial outreach as the content was no longer being distributed for viewers to watch.  </li>
          <li>Future goal: Our team aimed to create more content and try to reach more viewers so that when our platform was rebooted we had posts to distribute, therefore showing Instagram that we are real people and not a bot. </li> </p>
		
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram and TikTok</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Limited reach on Tiktok and Instagram:</h7>
          <p> <li>
          Our team was still in the process of developing the foundation of our brand such as the values, mission and vision. Therefore, we did not want to create concrete content that represented our brand until we finalized the idea. We decided to create a reel that aimed to build anticipation for viewers, showing that our football brand “ball4all” is coming soon, utilizing stock footage and our company logo.&nbsp;</li></p>

		<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">WEEK FOUR UPDATE - Instagram:</h6>
           <p><li>However, once we developed our account further in the following weeks, the first video now has 1042 views, 29 likes and 1 comment. The view count is broken down into two categories; initial plays being 794 and replays being 248. Unfortunately, the team is not able to access further insights as we did not change our account into a business account until week two.</li></p>

<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Week Two</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram got reactivated: </h7>
				
          <p>
<li> Our team was able to get the Instagram account reactivated by filing a report with Instagram. To ensure that this would not happen again, we focused on building the platform to represent to instagram that this is a real company. This included connecting an email with the Ball4All name in the email, instead of using one of our personal emails. In addition, we posted our first reel and updated the Instagram bio. This allowed us to create a solid foundation for the account.</li> </p>
			  
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Initial Instagram Engagement: </h7>

		   <p>
<li>After posting the first Instagram Reel, the Ball4All page gained 38 followers. In reflecting, we concluded that this outreach was because of each member of the team sharing the account with family and friends. In posting the reel on our personal accounts stories, our friends began to follow the account and engage with the post. </li></p>

	           </div>

<p><li>In addition, our team incorporated hashtags that reflected the post in an attempt to gain further outreach. These hashtags included: #foootball #onthepitch #footballtime #footballplayer #website #gameon #gearupforglory #footballrevolution #gamechanger #newintown #ultimatefootball. In comparison to our first post, we believe that the hashtags helped our engagement rates, however we were not able to compare the benefits until trying new hashtags in our next post.</li></p> 


<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Brand Introduction: </h7>
			
		   <p>
<li>In week two, our team also uploaded a static post to our Instagram. The purpose of our post was to introduce our brand to viewers, highlighting our company's purpose and goals. The elements of the post included: </li> </p>	
<li>A summarization of our company goals:</li>
		<ul>	
<li>A website for amateur football players. </li> 
<li>The company's scheduling and pitch finder features. </li> 
<li>Introducing the Ball4All digital stamp element. </li> 
		</ul>
<li>The ball4all company tagline </li>
			<ul> 
			  <li>All the benefits without commitment </li> </ul>
<li>The logo</li> 
<li>The ball4all colour palette.</li>
<ul><li>Green and orange.</li></ul>
<li>The purpose of the introduction post was to represent the highlights of our company while building anticipation and excitement. </li>
<ul>
<li>Our company aimed to build anticipation by introducing the features and benefits of the app without representing it in too much detail, as we planned to create future posts introducing each feature with detailed descriptions and images. Therefore, we provided viewers with a taste of what's to come. </li> </ul>
<li>In addition, we introduced our brand while utilizing a language and dialogue that was targeted for our audience, amateur footballer males 18-25. Our team strayed away from using formal language and a more professional route. Instead we described our brand using slang, informal language and lingo that is often used amongst our demographic. This included phrases such as: “kick-it”, “link up”, “no sweat”, “no drama” and many more. </li> 
<p><li>The introduction post also demonstrated a rebrand for the ball4all company. In our first post, our team initially wanted to have a more professional looking brand, with cinematic videos and polished language. Therefore, we incorporated a slow-motion video and a darker colour palette. However, in doing research and customer interviews, our team decided that a serious and cinematic marketing plan did not reflect our target audience. Allowing us to transform the page to include more bright colours, slang, abstract shapes and more. </li></p>

		   <p>
<li>In week two our team decided to change our Instagram profile into a business account. This allowed us to view a more indepth review for future analytics. The lack of access to detailed analytics limited our ability to gauge how effective our marketing strategies fully were in the first two weeks. </li></p>

          <p>
<li>In week three our reel was posted on Wednesday at 2:00pm, which was previously researched to be a day and time that provides engagement on the platform. </li>
<li>The reel was inspired from a popular trend on Instagram and TikTok, by utilizing this trend our team hoped to gain viewers through reliability and humour. </li> 
<li>In addition, we utilized hashtags once more ( #football, #soccer, #ball4all, #netherlands). This allowed the reel to obtain 518 plays, 21 likes and three comments. In addition, the reel was shared with friends and posted on our story so that people would have access to the content on their story and feed. </li>

<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Posting Content: </h7>
				
          <p> <li>In week four we focused on releasing plenty of content and posts. Over the weeks we worked on strengthening our brand and vision, therefore by week four we had a solid foundation of our ideas and brand features.&nbsp;</li></p>
          <p><li>Through the content we had created and compiled we planned to post a static post and reel each day. We began by posting a “coming soon” post in an attempt to build anticipation and excitement for what our brand was soon going to release. In this post we introduced new hashtags; #unleashthegame, #comingsoon, #football, #soccer, #netherlands, # goal, #gamechanger, as well as posting the content on our story once more. In utilizing these methods, our team was able to reach 13 likes, 4 comments and reach 33 accounts. &nbsp;</li></p>

<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">New Additions: </h7>
		<p><li>In week four our team incorporated new elements in an attempt to increase engagement. We utilized the features instagram provides for static posts such as adding the location (The Netherlands), a trending song (Carnival - Kanye West, Ty Dollan $ign and Rich The Kid), and tagging accounts (other accounts that specialize in football content).&nbsp;</li></p>
		<ul>
		<p><li>These are features we have continuously used throughout the week four and five static posts. We believe it allows viewers to find our content easier by using popular features. In addition, it also made the content more enjoyable to watch and was on theme with our audience as we used songs popular in the football community. </li></p>

<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Lack of Engagement: </h7>
				
          <p><li> In week five, we continued incorporating instagram features throughout our static posts, such as audios, locations and hashtags. However, we noticed a decline in outreach, as we were consistently getting engagement from our followers, with an average of 12 likes per post, however our outreach to new users was limited.&nbsp;</li></p>

          <p><li>Therefore, we implemented additional tactics in an attempt to gain more engagement. This involved creating story posts in which followers can share their opinions on football and our brand. However, we discovered that this tactic did not have the best results. Posting “yes or no” questions led us to gaining more responses, however questions in which users needed to answer through text received very limited responses. This taught us that in future we can focus on engagement tactics that involve simple and easy to complete tasks on the users end. </li></p>

<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 mb-3">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In reflecting on our marketing journey, it is evident that our campaign has undergone significant growth as overtime we began to utilize more features on the platform to promote our content. However, it is evident that we did not reach our goal of 3000 impressions. If the project were to continue, we would be able to use the experience we have gained in the month of content creation, to implement a strategy aimed at further enhancing engagement and solidifying our brand identity. The following recommendation represents a detailed outline of how we would strive for future success. </p>
		
		<p>1. Transition to a Business Account: The first recommendation and change our team would implement is making our social media accounts a business profile from the beginning. Transforming our platforms into business accounts would allow us to have access to in-depth analytics, representing the growth our company has shown overtime and from the beginning. In having this tool we would be able to review engagement insights and reflect on what we can do each post to improve, such as posting at a different time/day, using different hashtags and discovering the type of content that our audience enjoys most. </p>
		<p>2. Strategic Hashtags: In using hashtags, we believe it has helped our brand to get engagement, therefore in the future of our campaign we would continue to utilize relevant and trending hashtags across both social media platforms. However, a change we would implement is doing further research on what hashtags are trending and incorporating a lot more hashtags than 4-5, in order to enhance the chance of viewers to discover our company. </p>
		<p>3. Establishing a Consistent Tone of Voice: In reflecting, we discovered that it is crucial to establish a consistent tone of voice that resonates with our target audience from the beginning. Initially our team wanted to represent a more serious and cinematic approach to our content. However, after doing research, we quickly realized the type of content our target audience typically views which is more laid back. In addition, we realized the importance of our tone which was incorporating slang versus  professional text, which resonates more with our audience. Therefore, in creating a distinct brand voice, it allows us to connect more with our audience and establish a stronger brand identity. </p>  
		  <p>4. Posting More: In reflecting on the journey of our campaign, it is evident that we should have begun posting content sooner and more frequently. On platforms such as TikTok, posting everyday allows a greater chance to reach viewers and appear on users' pages. In addition, posting more frequently allows viewers to engage with content and develop a stronger understanding and relationship of the brand.    
</p>  
		<p> Overall, we believe in future planning, by following these future recommendations, discovered through research and content analytics, we believe we can redirect our campaign to increase visibility and growth. </p>
