<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Visual Identity</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Brand values/personality/audience</h6><li>
Based on our values, our brand design aims to express playfulness, masculinity, and passion. Therefore, we decide to use clean shapes and sharp graphic elements, as well as highly-saturated colors. </li>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Brand logo</h6>
<li>The logo is designed based on our unique brand feature - the digital baller passport. As such, we incorporated the image of a stamp and football into the logo design. </li>
<img height="200" src="images/ball4all_brand-styleguide-logos.jpg" alt="Typography">
			<img height="200" src="images/ball4all_logo-explanation.jpg" alt="Typography">
			<img height="200" src="images/ball4all-instagram-14.jpg" alt="Typography">

<p>
To make it easier for style applications on social media platforms/website/mobile app, we designed two versions of the logo: the original consisted of the primary brand colors, and the monogram (single-color) logo. The monogram logo is used on busy backgrounds/solid-colored backgrounds so that it can stand out from other elements.</p>

<p>The stamp-like logo is also utilized in players’ digital passport as a passport stamp that marks their football journey.</p>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-3 mb-3">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		  <h6> Our Brand </h6>
          <p>At Ball4all, we are on a mission to help users create an easily accessible community amongst amateur football players. In doing research, we discovered that football is an extremely common and popular team sport in The Netherlands, therefore we decided to focus on football to obtain maximum engagement and strengthen a community that is already visible in The Netherlands. In a world where people often have incredibly busy schedules, we aim to provide an accommodating and flexible platform that allows users to still participate in their passion. Our campaign is not only about promoting a product, it is about allowing people to celebrate the joy of football. </p>
          <h6> What is the Campaign About? </h6>
          <p>The Ball4All campaign revolves around distributing content that builds excitement while introducing our brand features. Through our posts we aim to build a community in the football world, demonstrating how we plan to make their life easier while gaining their trust by incorporating real people’ opinions through street interviews. Through our campaign we aim to spark meaningful conversations and represent the individuals who make up the community of The Netherlands football scene. </p>
		  <h6>The Message</h6>
          <p>The tagline for our campaign is “FWB. Football with Benefits. All the Benefits without Commitment”. Through the tagline our brand aims to demonstrate a company that provides features to help make a footballers experience and life easier, allowing them to access benefits of the sport without having to commit to a club. Our message is consistently represented throughout our content and social media platforms, including the tagline in videos and our bio, as well as having posts that further explain how we plan to execute our vision.</p>
		<p> 
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Promotional Activities Executed</h6>
<em>To bring our message to life and connect with our audience, we've executed a variety of promotional activities:</em>
<li> Instagram and TikTok Content: We've launched engaging campaigns on Instagram and TikTok to showcase our brand and its features. Through street interviews, brand feature descriptions, brand collaborations and company introduction posts, we have worked towards inviting our viewers to become part of the growing community. </li>
<li> Brand Collaborations: We have reached out to other brands to collaborate and share each other's content. Through this process we attempted to gain brand connections while continuously promoting and growing our brand. </li>
<li>Interactive Components and Trends: We've launched interactive components on our stories in an attempt to once again make viewers feel they are connected with the brand and have a voice. In addition, we have posted videos following trends such as street interviews as well as using trending audios in our video to gain traction. </li>
<li>Hashtags: In each of our posts we ensured to include at least 3-4 hashtags in the caption. These often consisted of tags that correlated with our post, as well as tags that are popular in the football community. </li>
</p>
<p> 
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">The Objective - SMART</h6>
<p>(Specific) We want to grow brand awareness by creating different types of content on both Instagram and Tik Tok. Our content will feature street interviews where we go around the hotspots of Breda, interacting directly with our target audience. Moreover, in these interviews, we ask questions about their difficulties as an amateur football player, whilst also asking about the usability of our features. Therefore, by posting these kinds of videos, we predict that most of our target audience have faced the same problems, creating a sense of belonging. In addressing the difficulties of amateur football players and seeking feedback on our brand features, it will allow our team to create a relatable brand, while genuinely addressing our target audience's needs. Creating a foundation of trust when building a long-lasting community. </p>

<p>(Measurable) Our goal would be to reach 3000 impressions on both platforms. Population of Breda (since we’re going to interact with it the most) 180.000. 6% of the Netherland’s population play football, extrapolating and applying it to the population of Breda, we have 10.800. 50% are males and given the fact our target audience is based on male amateur football players between the ages of 18-24, 3000 impressions is predicted to be an achievable goal.</p>

<p>(Achievable) By reaching our goal, we will attract more customers towards the website/app, building a long-lasting community in time. </p>

<p>(Timely) We’d like to achieve this goal within a month.</p>

</p></li>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">The Selected Channels/Platforms</h6>
We chose Instagram and TikTok as our channels due to the fact that they are the most relevant social media platforms for our target audience, male amateur football players aged 18-23. We got to this conclusion based on interviews with our target audience, all of them mentioning both. However, most of them use TikTok for entertainment and Instagram for both news and entertainment. Therefore, we chose to use Instagram for more “serious” posts such as our feature showcase, and TikTok for more funny, light-hearted content such as “types of footballers”.
In addition, Instagram and TikTok are both known for their engaging formats, providing an ideal platform for sharing content and gaining viewers. The platforms are powerful tools in building brand visibility and reaching a large audience, providing our brand the opportunity to introduce our company to a variety of potential customers. Through the various features that platforms provide, such as stories, reels, reposts and short TikTok our team is provided flexibility to share our content in various forms. Including call-to-action in our posts and utilizing engagement features on our stories, it encourages a relationship with our audience. The platforms allow our team to experiment and discover which format captures our audience's attention most.
Therefore, we utilized the platform's key benefits by incorporating trending audios, hashtags and many additional engagement tactics, in an attempt to reach our goal of 3000 impressions. The platforms provide a sense of community as it often caters to viewers interests, allowing football players in the Netherlands to discover our curated content for the sport.

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 mb-3">Learning Points</h4>
		<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Week One</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram got deleted: </h7>
          <p>
          <li>The Instagram got deleted as it was believed to be a robot account. Therefore, Instagram removed the ball4all account stating that it violates community guidelines. This severely limited our initial outreach as the content was no longer being distributed for viewers to watch.  </li>
          <li>Future goal: Our team aimed to create more content and try to reach more viewers so that when our platform was rebooted we had posts to distribute, therefore showing Instagram that we are real people and not a bot. </li> </p>
		
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram and TikTok</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Limited reach on Tiktok and Instagram:</h7>
          <p> <li>
          Our team was still in the process of developing the foundation of our brand such as the values, mission and vision. Therefore, we did not want to create concrete content that represented our brand until we finalized the idea. We decided to create a reel that aimed to build anticipation for viewers, showing that our football brand “ball4all” is coming soon, utilizing stock footage and our company logo.&nbsp;</li></p>

		<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">WEEK FOUR UPDATE - Instagram:</h6>
           <p><li>However, once we developed our account further in the following weeks, the first video now has 1042 views, 29 likes and 1 comment. The view count is broken down into two categories; initial plays being 794 and replays being 248. Unfortunately, the team is not able to access further insights as we did not change our account into a business account until week two.</li></p>

<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Week Two</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram got reactivated: </h7>
				
          <p>
<li> Our team was able to get the Instagram account reactivated by filing a report with Instagram. To ensure that this would not happen again, we focused on building the platform to represent to instagram that this is a real company. This included connecting an email with the Ball4All name in the email, instead of using one of our personal emails. In addition, we posted our first reel and updated the Instagram bio. This allowed us to create a solid foundation for the account.</li> </p>
			  
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Initial Instagram Engagement: </h7>

		   <p>
<li>After posting the first Instagram Reel, the Ball4All page gained 38 followers. In reflecting, we concluded that this outreach was because of each member of the team sharing the account with family and friends. In posting the reel on our personal accounts stories, our friends began to follow the account and engage with the post. </li></p>

	           </div>

<p><li>In addition, our team incorporated hashtags that reflected the post in an attempt to gain further outreach. These hashtags included: #foootball #onthepitch #footballtime #footballplayer #website #gameon #gearupforglory #footballrevolution #gamechanger #newintown #ultimatefootball. In comparison to our first post, we believe that the hashtags helped our engagement rates, however we were not able to compare the benefits until trying new hashtags in our next post.</li></p> 


<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Brand Introduction: </h7>
			
		   <p>
<li>In week two, our team also uploaded a static post to our Instagram. The purpose of our post was to introduce our brand to viewers, highlighting our company's purpose and goals. The elements of the post included: </li> </p>	
<li>A summarization of our company goals:</li>
		<ul>	
<li>A website for amateur football players. </li> 
<li>The company's scheduling and pitch finder features. </li> 
<li>Introducing the Ball4All digital stamp element. </li> 
		</ul>
<li>The ball4all company tagline </li>
			<ul> 
			  <li>All the benefits without commitment </li> </ul>
<li>The logo</li> 
<li>The ball4all colour palette.</li>
<ul><li>Green and orange.</li></ul>
<li>The purpose of the introduction post was to represent the highlights of our company while building anticipation and excitement. </li>
<ul>
<li>Our company aimed to build anticipation by introducing the features and benefits of the app without representing it in too much detail, as we planned to create future posts introducing each feature with detailed descriptions and images. Therefore, we provided viewers with a taste of what's to come. </li> </ul>
<li>In addition, we introduced our brand while utilizing a language and dialogue that was targeted for our audience, amateur footballer males 18-25. Our team strayed away from using formal language and a more professional route. Instead we described our brand using slang, informal language and lingo that is often used amongst our demographic. This included phrases such as: “kick-it”, “link up”, “no sweat”, “no drama” and many more. </li> 
<p><li>The introduction post also demonstrated a rebrand for the ball4all company. In our first post, our team initially wanted to have a more professional looking brand, with cinematic videos and polished language. Therefore, we incorporated a slow-motion video and a darker colour palette. However, in doing research and customer interviews, our team decided that a serious and cinematic marketing plan did not reflect our target audience. Allowing us to transform the page to include more bright colours, slang, abstract shapes and more. </li></p>

<li>In week two our team decided to change our Instagram profile into a business account. This allowed us to view a more indepth review for future analytics.

		<p><li>In week four our team incorporated new elements in an attempt to increase engagement. We utilized the features instagram provides for static posts such as adding the location (The Netherlands), a trending song (Carnival - Kanye West, Ty Dollan $ign and Rich The Kid), and tagging accounts (other accounts that specialize in football content).&nbsp;</li></p>
		<ul>
		<p><li>These are features we have continuously used throughout the week four and five static posts. We believe it allows viewers to find our content easier by using popular features. In addition, it also made the content more enjoyable to watch and was on theme with our audience as we used songs popular in the football community. </li></p>

	<p><li>Through this method we were able to get three accounts to share our content on their story, telling their audience to look at our page if they are interested in football. This provided a minimal boost in our content, with the content they promoted getting an additional 40 views and 3-6 more accounts reached. </li></p>

<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Street Interviews: </h7>		
          <p><li> We decided to record street interviews asking the people of Breda questions about our website and its features. It did not gain much views however we did gain alot of likes since we decided to add the hashtag #street interviews. We gained a total  of 66 likes and 3 followers.&nbsp;</li></p>
          <p><li>We also decided to add captions to these videos in which it is easier for people to read and we decided to put that our website is coming soon at the end of each video. </li></p>

<h5 class="mt-4 mb-3">Week Five</h5>
<h6 class="mt-4 mb-3">Instagram</h6>
<h7 class="mt-4 mb-3">Lack of Engagement: </h7>
				
          <p><li> In week five, we continued incorporating instagram features throughout our static posts, such as audios, locations and hashtags. However, we noticed a decline in outreach, as we were consistently getting engagement from our followers, with an average of 12 likes per post, however our outreach to new users was limited.&nbsp;</li></p>

          <p><li>Therefore, we implemented additional tactics in an attempt to gain more engagement. This involved creating story posts in which followers can share their opinions on football and our brand. However, we discovered that this tactic did not have the best results. Posting “yes or no” questions led us to gaining more responses, however questions in which users needed to answer through text received very limited responses. This taught us that in future we can focus on engagement tactics that involve simple and easy to complete tasks on the users end. </li></p>

<p> Lastly, in week five we posted a final TikTok and Reel to build anticipation and wrap up our work. The video once again displayed our brand name, logo, tagline and features. The video gained a decent amount of views with 72 plays. Our overall goal was to finalize our content by reintroducing our brand and reminding everyone what the website will include.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 mb-3">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In reflecting on our marketing journey, it is evident that our campaign has undergone significant growth as overtime we began to utilize more features on the platform to promote our content. However, it is evident that we did not reach our goal of 3000 impressions. If the project were to continue, we would be able to use the experience we have gained in the month of content creation, to implement a strategy aimed at further enhancing engagement and solidifying our brand identity. The following recommendation represents a detailed outline of how we would strive for future success. </p>
		
		<p>1. Transition to a Business Account: The first recommendation and change our team would implement is making our social media accounts a business profile from the beginning. Transforming our platforms into business accounts would allow us to have access to in-depth analytics, representing the growth our company has shown overtime and from the beginning. In having this tool we would be able to review engagement insights and reflect on what we can do each post to improve, such as posting at a different time/day, using different hashtags and discovering the type of content that our audience enjoys most. </p>
		<p>2. Strategic Hashtags: In using hashtags, we believe it has helped our brand to get engagement, therefore in the future of our campaign we would continue to utilize relevant and trending hashtags across both social media platforms. However, a change we would implement is doing further research on what hashtags are trending and incorporating a lot more hashtags than 4-5, in order to enhance the chance of viewers to discover our company. </p>
		<p>3. Establishing a Consistent Tone of Voice: In reflecting, we discovered that it is crucial to establish a consistent tone of voice that resonates with our target audience from the beginning. Initially our team wanted to represent a more serious and cinematic approach to our content. However, after doing research, we quickly realized the type of content our target audience typically views which is more laid back. In addition, we realized the importance of our tone which was incorporating slang versus  professional text, which resonates more with our audience. Therefore, in creating a distinct brand voice, it allows us to connect more with our audience and establish a stronger brand identity. </p>  
		  <p>4. Posting More: In reflecting on the journey of our campaign, it is evident that we should have begun posting content sooner and more frequently. On platforms such as TikTok, posting everyday allows a greater chance to reach viewers and appear on users' pages. In addition, posting more frequently allows viewers to engage with content and develop a stronger understanding and relationship of the brand.    
</p>  
		<p> Overall, we believe in future planning, by following these future recommendations, discovered through research and content analytics, we believe we can redirect our campaign to increase visibility and growth. </p>

          <ul>
           Customer segments
             <li>&nbsp;Getting “team sports players” as our assigned audience group, we decided to narrow down the customer segment to male amateur football players age 18-30 living in the Netherlands, as we assumed having a unique target audience would benefit our brand in looking for specific problems as well as developing features that centralizes the target segment. Due to its widespread popularity in the Netherlands and community values, we decided to include football into our audience’s characteristics, and our brand targeted male amateur players since football is primarily male-dominated, and it’s been shown that the professional segment of football is already prioritized, which drove us to put emphasis on the amateur segments for unique problems and solutions.</li>
             <li>&nbsp;Problems From the customer segment, we determined three main problems that customers may face while playing amateur football, which were schedule flexibility, pitch booking, and finding teammates. Based on which, our initial solution was to develop a platform for male amateur football players that provide the services according to our assumed problems. Channels Our main channels would be our website and social media platforms including Tiktok and Instagram, since the chosen customer segment is primarily Gen Zs and Millenials whose screen time is spent mostly on Instagram and Tiktok. The social media platforms would be utilized for our marketing campaign, supporting the website that provides the services. &nbsp;</li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Justification</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To clearly identify the customers’ problems, our interview questions focus on both the social and psychological benefits that football brings to them, as well as personal life aspects that are football-related for hidden problems.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The majority of our interviewees expressed these primary traits and concerns:&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Football was introduced to them from a very early age, mostly by male family members/friends or their favorite teams. Some stated that they were influenced by acquaintances who played professional football.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>They use social media platforms to stay updated about football news and events. They follow fan/official accounts of renowned football clubs on Instagram, and also use this platform to connect with other players and organize matches in local areas. Whatsapp is also utilized to contact teammates and regulate matches.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Football provides them with a sense of community and accomplishment. The sport also aids them in socializing and stress relieving.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Their frustrations include lack of equipment/fields, communication issues (hard to contact people/finding teammates through social media platforms, schedule flexibility, and lack of motivation due to the above difficulties.&nbsp;</li>
			  
            <p class="fw-bold">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">Lean canvas modifications</p>
            <li>Customer segments- We realized that there’s a significant difference in lifestyles between age 18-25 and 25-30. The academic, professional, and social commitments will differentiate age 18-25 from 25-30 regarding football playing habits, spending habits, and availability. As a result, we modify our customer segment to age group 18-23 for a more focused brand identity and services.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Problems- Based on the problem interviews, we were able to identify two main problems: Communication: The lack of a convenient and cohesive communicating platform prevents the players from finding available teammates, regulating matches, and looking for good facilities. Miscommunication causes a lot of disruptions in playing time which is already limited due to work and personal life. Schedule flexibility: The misalignment in availability makes it difficult for players to meet up and organize matches together.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Solutions We came up with three brand features that potentially solves the identified problems: Availability input: The players are able to set up their schedules on the website to see which fields/players are available at a chosen time frame. Pitch booking: The feature introduces a list of available pitches for players to choose at a specific time frame. Digital baller passport: A digital passport for players to display their information and collect digital stamps given to them after each match. Match-making: The feature matches players with other players who are at a specific skill level and available at a chosen time frame. We expected these features to solve disruptions caused by the communication and flexibility issues as well as motivate players to play football.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Unfair advantage During our problem interviews, we noticed that the majority of our interviewees expressed great satisfaction towards the sense of accomplishment that scoring goals provides them. As such, we came up with the idea of having a digital baller passport as one of the main brand features. The 2-page passport will show players’ information and availability and a blank space for dated digital stamps (our brand logo) acquired after finishing a match. The passport also allows other players to have basic knowledge of their teammates, making socializing and teaming up easier.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Cost structure- After our problem interviews, we realized that an app would be more practical for our target audience, so we pivoted towards it. However, we decided to keep the website as a corporate page, given the fact that it is easily accessible. The maintenance cost of an app usually varies based on how complex the app is. Given the fact that our app is straightforward and easy to use, a rough estimate would be around 230 euros per month. Moreover, our website is used mainly to showcase our features, serving as a portal towards the app mostly. Therefore, an estimated maintenance cost for the website would be 370 euros per year(https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-much-website-cost#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20maintaining%20a%20website%20ranges%20from%20%24400,in%20a%20major%20website%20redesign). For our marketing campaign, we will collaborate with university students that have (or study towards) a Marketing specialization, for instance BUas Creative Business students during their production house days. We have decided to implement this strategy in order to cut down on costs, given the fact that our app is free and we run solely on external sources of revenue.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Revenue Streams- Based on our assumptions, our revenue streams should come from both partnerships with football pitches and football equipment ads. The partnerships would be commission based either from a percentage from the bookings made through our app, or a flat fee for each referral. Based on our problem interviews where our target audience was struggling with finding the right equipment, we would also run ads displaying football equipment from different manufacturers. These ads can be targeted based on user preferences, location, and other relevant data to maximize engagement and conversion rates. An exact percentage would be difficult to provide, since data could not be found of similar business models. For the sake of this project, we would take 10% of booking as an example. Given the fact that in our problem interviews, our target audience mentioned the fact that they would like to play football once a week, and a month is comprised of roughly four weeks, we anticipate 4 matches per month. Moreover, the average rate for booking a football pitch in the Netherlands is 55 euros(https://footy.netlify.app/pick-location/nl/?lang=en). </li>

          <p class="fw-bold">Summary of solution interviews&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our solution interviews focused on confirming the problems and collecting reviews on our product prototype to see if we should pivot or persevere with the current direction.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Highlights of the interviews:&nbsp;</li>
            <li>One interviewee expressed great frustration (laughing, talking with sarcasm) towards the inconvenience of having to contact people and synchronize schedules through Whatsapp.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Most interviewees said they would benefit from a feature that helps them connect with compatible players. Some interviewees didn’t have the need for such feature, unless they wanted to meet new people. The feature will be helpful in small areas where you need to select players to make a team.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The interviewees expressed enthusiasm about a platform where availability options are provided, because it helps them gather a team and organize matches more quickly and easily.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The interviewees find it unnecessary for a skill level input feature, because to them “winning is important but fun is the top priority”. It depends on each player’ purpose of playing football.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The interviewees looked forward to the feature where they can see the availability of the pitches which allows them to book in advance, because they’d prefer to have a familiar field to play regularly to having to switch fields every week.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;One interviewee stated that it would be helpful to add players’ (preferred) positions to their profile.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;One interviewee said that they really enjoyed the fact that you can see who you are playing with before hand and not find out on the spot.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>One interviewee said that we should include a second feature in which they can also invite friends to join their team. </li>

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The customers recognized the problems and found most product features helpful. We removed the skill level feature and decided to persevere with the rest.</li>
